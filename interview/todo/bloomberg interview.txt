Write a small program that takes two strings as input and prints two
numbers (n1 and n2) as output, where:

n1 is the number of letters in the first string that each has a match in
the second string in the same position in the string.
n2 is the number of letters in the first string that each has a match in
the second string but does not have a match in the same position.

Note that each match is unique. That is, no letter in either string can
participate in more than one match.
I.e., each letter instance can contribute at most once to n1+n2.

Some examples:
abc abcd -> 3 0
aab aacd -> 2 0
aba aab -> 1 2
aba bab -> 0 2 4

Puzzle: You've got an 8Ã—8 checkerboard and a bunch of dominoes that each fit nicely on two squares of the checkboard. You can easily tile the entire checkerboard with these dominoes. Now say that you remove two squares, one at one corner and the other at the opposite corner. You're left with 62 squares. Can you tile this with the dominoes? If so, show how. If not, prove why not.

I was given a set of data structures and a set of complexities for search and insert operations, and asked to fill in the right ones.

Before doing that I was asked, "given the possibility that a mad monkey was asked to match the data structures with the corresponding complexities what is the probability of him getting it right, assuming he could pick the same complexity over and over again?"

Gave me a piece of code...which is as follows...

Class A
{
int x;
}

Class B
{
int y;
}

Class C : public A, B
{
int z;
}

A *aa;
B *bb;
C cc;

aa = &cc;
bb = &cc;

Tell me do aa and bb point to the same address? If yes or no....why?
